## Project title
Analysis of Stock Price Predictions using LSTM

## Motivation
I always wanted to properly delve into machine/deep learning models, and specifically apply it in an area that I am passionate in. Since I was also interested in stocks and wanted to examine the relationships surrounding the various factors (including seasonality, Bollinger bands and price pressures), I wanted to come up with a project which involved these 2 aspects. 


## Tech/framework used
Python, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Finta


## Features
In this project, I attempt to improve upon other predictive models of price prediction by altering the number of layers and through feature engineering, come up with accurate models that can as best as possible mimic the price difference. Most importantly, I iteratively tried to improve on the models while avoiding problems mentioned in many other articles, including look-ahead bias or copying yesterday's price. Concepts of seasonality, validation loss, stationarity with proper data visualisation as well as LSTM stacking/boosting were applied to improve the results. 


## How to use?
To use, ensure that the frameworks and libraries (Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Finta) are installed.

There are 3 models that can be run and tested:

(a) basic_model.py
The basic model with the base LSTM layers with no tuning (only features added in)

(b) magnitude_model.py
This model contains the tuned LSTM layers with feature engineering, that is used to predict the magnitude of the price

(c) difference_model.py
This model contains the tuned and stacked LSTM layers that is used to predict differences that is (a) iteratively added to a base point to generate a predicted graph and (b) added to each actual price at time t to get the predicted price at t + 1.
